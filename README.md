# command I use to compile:
```
g++ main.cpp -mwindows -lgdi32 -ldwmapi -o FastSwitcher.exe
```
# then just run the exe

# to make it usable like alt+tab use AutoHotkey or any other software to run the exe on a specific hotkey

# TODO
- type the name of a software to open it quicker
- hotkeys like 1, 2, 3 to select the element
